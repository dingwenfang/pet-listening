Track 2 
Narrator :You will hear two friends talking about the kind of flat they would like to live in .
Boy :
Wouldn 'tit be great to live right at the top of that lock of flats ,with views across the city ?
Girl :
Nice views are fine but I 'mnot very keen on lifts .
I think I 'drather be on the ground floor .It 'dbe good to live in a building that 'snot far from a bus 
stop ,too .
Boy :
Or an underground station .
Girl :
Right .But the most important thing for me would be to have my own room ,so it 'dhave to be a 
three -bedroomapartment .
Boy :
I don 'tmind sharing with my brother ,so two would be enough for me .

Narrator :You will hear a boy telling his friend about changing school .
Girl :
I haven 'tseen you for a long time .How do you feel now about your new school ?
Boy :
Well ,before I moved at the beginning of January ,I thought it 'dbe difficult to make friends with people in my new class ,but they 'vegiven me a really warm welcome .Of course I 'ma bit sad that 
I don 'tsee anyone from my previous school ,but there 'snothing I can do about that .My studies 
seem to be going better than I 'dexpected ,too ,so making the change hasn 'tbeen too hard ,really .

Narrator :You will hear a girl talking about a trip to the beach .
Boy :
How was your day out ?
Girl :
Great !The bus left early on Saturday so I had to get up at 5 a .m .,but that meant we got to the beach really early .
Boy :
Did you go for a swim ?
Girl :
Yes ,I thought I would enjoy that but it was a bit cold so we hired a little boat instead and sailed round the bay .That was fun ,too ,but not as muchas having a game of volleyball .We 'regoing there 
again in July when it 'llbe too hot for beach sports but swimming in the sea will be wonderful !
Narrator :You will hear two friends talking about the town where they live .
Girl :
It 'squite a good place to live ,isn 'tit ?I mean ,for a small town .
Boy :
Yes ,and it 'sprobably about the right size ,too .
In bigger places there are problems like street 
crime ,especially at night ,but here you feel safe 
anywhere ,really .
Girl :
That 'strue ,although everywhere you go round 
here ,the roads are really busy .All that noise and 
pollution is horrible early in the morning .
Boy :
I know .I wish people would walk or go by bike 
instead .

Narrator :You will hear a boy talking to a friend about a 
shop .
Girl :
I don 'treally know this part of town .Where 'sthe 
best place to buy a T -shirt?
Boy :
The little shop on the corner isn 'tbad .The range 
of things there is a bit limited but just about 
everything is amazingly good value ,especially if 
you compare it to the bigger shops .
Girl :
The one opposite the station ?
Boy :
Yes ,you can find almost anything you want there 
but it always seems to be really crowded ,with lots 
of people waiting to pay because it 'sshort of staff .
Girl :
Thanks -I'lldefinitely avoid that one .

Narrator :You will hear two friends talking about their 
homes .
Boy :
I like my room ,though I haven 'tgot much space 
for my things .
Girl :
Mine 'sabout the right size really ,but I know what 
you mean .My cupboards and shelves are far too 
small .
Boy :
At least mine 'sgot big windows ,so I get plenty of 
sunshine .
Girl :
I do too ,though it 'sa pity I can 'tturn the central 
heating up in winter .
Boy :
Does it get noisy ?It can do at my place ,especially 
in the morning rush hour .
Girt :
My flat mate complains about traffic noise waking 
her up too !But I 'mon the inside of the building ,
so I hardly notice it .
