 Track 14

 Kirsty:

 Hi Jack, I forgot I'm playing tennis later and I've left all my things at home! Can you find them for me? And could you bring them with you later?

 Jack: Sure, I'll go and look for them in your room now.

 Where's your racket?

 Kirsty: You'll see that as soon as you walk in. It's lying on

 the floor just in front of the wardrobe.

 Jack: Right, I'm just opening the door... yes, there it is.

 Kirsty:

 Great. Now there should also be some tennis balls, four I think, on the shelf that's opposite the window. Can you see it?

 Jack: Yes, I can.

 Kirsty: They're actually behind the clock there.

 Jack: Yes, all four are there. I'll bring those too. What

 else?

 Kirsty: My trainers. Do you see the small table next to my

 bed? Well they're under that.

 Jack: I've got them. Is that everything?

 Kirsty: Just one more thing. Could you get my T-shirt?

 Jack: Sure. Where is it?

 Kirsty: If you look inside the wardrobe, on the right, you'll

 see it on the shelf above the one where my jeans are. And that's all.

 Jack: OK, if I can find a big enough bag, I think I can

 carry everything.

 Kirsty: Thanks, Jack.

 Jack: No problem, see you later.
