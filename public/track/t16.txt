 Track 16
 Chris: Hi, Ava. Are you and Megan going away on holiday
 soon?
 Ava:
 Yes, on Saturday. We want to set off very early in
 the morning.
 chris: Are you going to the coast?
 Ava:
 No, we went off beach holidays a long time ago.
 There are always too many people. We've decided
 to take up skiing instead. We're off to the Alps.
 Chris: Do you know how to ski?
 Ava:
 Er, not really. That's why I'm going to put my name
 down for lessons.
 Chris: tried skiing once but I found it really difficult.
 After three days gave up and went home!
 Ava:
 Well, the lessons go on until the afternoon, every
 day, so I hope I can improve quickly. I'm really
 looking forward to trying, anyway!
 Chris: Yes, I'm sure you'll have a great time.
