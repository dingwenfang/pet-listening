 Track 17
 Rosa: In this photo I can see some boys, teenage boys,
 and they're skateboarding. The boy at the front is
 wearing a red cap, a purple T-shirt and light-grey
 trousers, and I think his skateboard is blue with
 white wheels. They're on a road, but it looks like a
 very quiet road because there are no cars moving
 on it. In the background there are some buildings
 so it seems they're in a city, but there are a lot of
 trees too so maybe it's not the centre of the city.
 There also appear to be some traffic lights behind
 them and possibly that's why there aren't any cars
 coming. The weather looks cloudy, it's not a sunny
 day, but I don't think it's cold so it's probably in
 the middle of the day.
