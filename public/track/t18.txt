 Track 18

 Joe:

 Where did you go on holiday, Sonia?

 Sonia: Well, I went to Marrakesh with my family.

 Joe:

 Marrakesh? Where's that?

 Sonia:

 It's a city in Morocco, North Africa.

 Joe:

 What did you do there?

 Sonia:

 Well, you know my dad. He loves to see everything so we went sightseeing almost every day.

 Joe:

 Did you see a lot of things?

 Sonia: Yeah! We looked around so many palaces,

 mosques and museums and of course I took lots of photos. You've seen them, haven't you?

 Joe:

 I think so. Do you like visiting museums?

 Sonia: It's OK but I prefer going shopping and wow, in

 Marrakesh the Souks are amazing.

 Joe:

 What's a Souk?

 Sonia: It's an open-air marketplace where you can buy

 almost everything.

 Joe:

 So, did you buy anything?

 Sonia:

 Oh yes! I bought some little gifts for my friends and got a couple of scarves.

 Joe:

 I'm not sure I'd enjoy that kind of holiday.

 Sonia: What do you mean?

 Joe:

 When go on holiday, I prefer hanging out on the beach. It's much more relaxing.
