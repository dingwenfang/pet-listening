 Track 21

 Ani:

 Er, I come from New Zealand, I live in Katikati which is a town about six hours away from the capital, Wellington. There are only about 4,000 people there-it's tiny. My town is amazing because it's also an open-air gallery. There are paintings on the walls, sculptures everywhere and other artwork. Katikati is a very nice place to live because it never gets too crowded and because it's a small town, it's extremely safe.

 It's also very easy to get into the countryside to go walking, fishing or even hunting. Sometimes, I find living here quite boring. I'd like to live somewhere bigger with a more lively nightlife and with more cinemas, shopping centres and sports centres.
