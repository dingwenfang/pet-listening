 Track 23

 Dad: Someone from work has just got back from an

 in an apartment in the city centre and they absolutely fantastic holiday in Paris. They staye

 loads of sightseeing. He said the art museums were amazing, better than the museums here.

 Why don't we all go to Paris for our next holiday?

 Son:

 Dad! Not more museums! And don't you think

 Paris will be really crowded? I'd like to go somewhere quieter. We could hire a campervan and go camping. My friend Dan went to a park in the USA and he says it's one of the most beautiful places in the world.

 Daughter: Not camping again, please! We got really wet

 last time. That was the worst holiday of my life!

 What about trying a new sport like surfing or snorkelling? It would be so much fun. Yeah! Let's do that! Please!

 Mum:

 Um... But snorkelling is as dangerous as surfing. I'm not sure I fancy doing either of those two sports.

 Dad:

 OK. What do you suggest?

 Mum: Well, how about a cruise?

 Dad:

 Why do you think we should choose that?

 Mum:

 Because there's so much to do and we don't need to plan where we're going to stay or what we're going to do. It's all done for you.

 Dad:

 What can you do on a cruise? Surely a city break is more interesting than a cruise?

 Mum:

 No, no at all! There are loads of different things to do-there are swimming pools and gyms, cinemas and organised entertainment. And then when you wake up in the morning, you're in a new place!I think that's a lot more exciting than other types of holiday.

 Daughter: That sounds perfect!

 Son: I agree!

 Dad: OK.
