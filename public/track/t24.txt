 Track 24

 Narrator: You will hear a young woman talki ng about taking

 part in a singing contest.
 Man:

 What did you think of the judges'scores? woman: Well, I thought I'd sung pretty well, certainly

 nothing to be ashamed of, but I must admit they were lower than I'd expected. I knew then that I had little chance of beating the others, but at least I'd done my best. For me that's the most important thing.

 Man:

 Yes, definitely. So do you think you'll try again in

 next year's contest?

 Woman: Yes, if I can. I might not win but think I could do

 better than this year.

 Narrator: You will hear two friends talking about camping

 Boy:

 I'm going camping in the mountains on Friday.

 Girl:

 That'll be great fun, especially with the hot weather we're having right now, but the

 temperatures there can really drop at night, even in summer. You'd better put a jacket and a thick sweater in your backpack instead of lots of things to eat. You can always get a tasty meal in one of the local villages. Where exactly will you be going?

 Boy:

 Up by the lake.

 Girl:

 s beautiful there, isn't it? But perhaps it'd be best to put your tent up somewhere else. At this time of year the mosquitoes there are awful. They never stop biting!

3 Narrator: You will hear boy talking to his friend about a

 literature exam.

 Girl:

 You've got that literature exam next week, haven't you? How's the revision going?

 Boy:

 I thought I'd be getting tired of it by now, but your suggestion that I should watch films of the books we have to study has made it more interesting and understand the stories better. Usually just before an important exam like this one I feel really worried about what could go wrong on the day, this time's quite different, though.

 Girl:

 That's great to hear. I'm sure you'll do really well on Monday morning. Good luck!

4 Narrator: You will hear a girl telling a friend about studying

 abroad.

 Boy:

 Did you enjoy your month abroad?

 Girl:

 Yes, I was in a small town in the countryside. The lessons were good even though the rest of the class were younger than me and we didn't have much in common. had a lovely room in the house where I was staying. The couple I was staying with were kind to me but they had a busy social life and I hardly saw them. So I went to the main square where all the shops and cafes are and made friends there. We had a great time hanging

 out and chatting.

5 Narrator: You will hear a boy telling his friend about how he

 travels to school.

 Girl:

 I see you're using your bike every day now, instead of coming to school in your mum's car.

 Boy:

 Yes, I've been doing that since the beginning of term. Actually, she still goes right past school on her way to work, so it's not about protecting the environment, spending less on petrol or anything like that. It's just that I realised I was spending

 nearly all my time sitting down, in class and at home, and thought I'd better do something

 about it.

 Girl:

 That's a good idea. Maybe I should do the same.

6 Narrator: You will hear a girl talking to a friend about going

 shopping.

 Boy:

 So how was your shopping trip yesterday imagine the city centre's pretty crowded on a

 Saturday morning at this time of the year.

 Girl:

 Yes, there were lots of people walking in the streets and the department store was full of customers, too. I don't mind that, but wasn't happy about having shop assistants trying to sell me stuff when all I wanted to do was look at things on the shelves. I noticed they were bothering other customers, too. If they carry on Like that their shop won't be full much longer.
