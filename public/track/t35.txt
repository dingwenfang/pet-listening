Track 35
Toby: Hi Leon, Toby here. I'm really pleased you're
coming to our new house next week. The quickest
way here is by train to the city centre, which takes
an hour and is usually on time. Then you can get
on the number 64 bus to Edgely, getting off by the
stadium. From there it's a 15-minute walk. Or, if
you don't feel like walking, you could jump in a
taxi and ask the driver to take you to the end of
Valley Road. When you get out of the taxi, you'll
see our place right in front of you. See you soon!
