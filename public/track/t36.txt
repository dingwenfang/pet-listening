Track 36
Ava:
Well, it shows a white and blue plane at an airport
and there are also a lot of people. I can see the
windows and open doors of the plane, one of its
wings and an engine. There are people getting
off the plane and they're on the thing that goes
down to the ground. There's one of these at the
back of the plane and I think there's another
one at the front. There are some people walking
past the plane and talking to each other. At the
front there are two girls, teenage girls. The taller
one's wearing blue clothes and she's carrying a
kind of little case and maybe a backpack, too
I don't think the one dressed in grey is carrying
anything. Behind the plane I can see a person
who works at the airport, in a yellow jacket, next
to the passengers' suitcases. They're on a thing
with wheels that carries cases from the plane into
the airport building. The weather looks too nice,
I mean, quite nice, because most of the people
are wearing summer clothes, and although it's a
British Airways plane I can see the word 'lberia'so
I think the picture was probably taken in Spain!
