Mr Edwards: Hi Kristian. How are you?
Kristian:
Er...OK.
Mr Edwards: Your dad's got in contact with me because he
says you're not very sure about your future.
Shall we have a chat about it? What are your
favourite subjects?
Kristian:
Well,that's not the problem...I am sure
about my future. I'd really like to go to drama
school. Everyone says I'm good at acting.
Mr Edwards: How old are you, Kristian?
Kristian:
That's the problem. I'm only fifteen so I'll
need my parents' permission if I want to go
to drama school. They say I have to stay at
school until I'm eighteen, but...if I stay at
school until I'm eighteen, it will be too late.
Mr Edwards: Too late for what?
Kristian:
If I want to be an actor, I have to start
training at an early age. So, if I don't start
now,I'll be too old.
Mr Edwards: Maybe we should look at other ways of
getting training. Have you thought about
acting classes?
Kristian:
Yes, but I would have to give up football if
I went to classes after school. That's why
I think drama school would be a good
solution. If I studied at drama school, I'd
have enough time for everything.
Mr Edwards: Have your parents seen you performing on
stage?
Kristian:
No, not for a long time. I wasn't in this year's
English play because none of my friends
were in it.
Mr Edwards: I see. Let's think about ways you can get
some more acting experience. Have you
thought about being a film extra?
Kristian:
What's that?
