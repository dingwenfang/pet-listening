Carter: Hey Will! Is that you?
Will:
Carter ! How's things ?
Carter: Great! You know I've been working on a new
YouTube channel? Well, I'm looking for someone
to present it. Would you do it?
Will:
Me? Sorry. I'm too shy. I'd be terrible. What would
your perfect presenter look like?
Carter: You know, someone with an interesting face. He
should be medium height, look around sixteen
years old with long, straight hair. He should
probably be good-looking, too.
Will:
Um...there's John.He's got a great voice.
Carter: Yeah but I think I'm looking for someone without a
beard or moustache.
Will:
So no beard or moustache, right?
Carter: Right!
Will:
What about Robert? He's got that cool scar on his
chin.
Carter: He's got blue eyes, hasn't he?
Will:
That's right and everyone says he's honest and
reliable. Do you want his phone number?
