On today's programme, we're going to learn how to make
chicken burritos from Mexico. First of all, mix the chicken
together with salt, pepper and chili and then fry it. Don't
cook it on a high heat or the burrito will be rather dry. Next,
boil some rice until it is just soft. Then prepare the other
ingredients.

Everyone loves Japanese sushi and this is actually something
you can make at home quite easily. Wash one and a half cups
of sushi rice and then boil it for twelve minutes. Next, decide
on your ingredients. Use cucumber, carrot and tuna for your
first sushi rolls and then try other things.

Masala Dosa is a vegetarian breakfast dish from South India.
To make it at home, buy the dosa from an Indian supermarket
and fill it with spicy boiled potato. Don't forget to serve your
dosa with lassi, an Indian yoghurt drink.
