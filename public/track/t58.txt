Track 58
Ethan: Well, there's lots you can do to save water. At
home, for instance, you can have a quick shower
instead of a bath. I read in an article that having a
bath uses 80 to 100 litres of water.
Lily:
Right.And when you're brushing your teeth,let's
say, you should turn off the tap when you're not
actually using any water. And do the same when
you're doing other things, such as washing your
hair.
Ethan: Good idea. And it's important to check the taps
are completely turned off, especially in places like
schools. The article said that a tap which loses just
one drop a second, for example, wastes 20 litres a
day!
