Catherine: I'm sure some of you have got questions about
this unusual event. Yes, you in the front. Can you
say your name first, please?
Emily: Hi, I'm Emily. Can I choose the members of my
team?
Catherine: Good question. And yes, you can choose up to 3
other people to join your team. However, each
person will need to make a separate application.
Who's next? Yes?
Peter:
Hi Catherine. My name's Peter and I've got a
question. Do we need to pay anything to take part?
Catherine: Another great question. Yes, there's a fee of Â£5
per person. This is to show us that you're really
interested in the event. Anyone else? Yes, you
over there in the red and white T-shirt.
Connor: I'm Connor. This all sounds brilliant. How do we
register for the competition?
Catherine: It's easy. As I said before, you can do it all online.
Log in to our website and fill in the application
form. I think you're next.
Samir: Hi Catherine. I'm Samir. What do we do if we
have technical problems?
Catherine: Interesting point. If you have problems with
applying for the event, please get in touch with
us. If you have problems on the day, our team
will be available. However, it is up to you to make
sure that your laptop is working well before the
day of the event. Any more questions? Yes, you
over there in the blue hat.
Charlotte: Hi, I'm Charlotte. What are the prizes?
Catherine: Full details of the prizes are on our website...
