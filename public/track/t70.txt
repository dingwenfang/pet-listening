Examiner: What did you do yesterday evening?
Maria: Yesterday evening I went to the cinema with
some friends. I often watch films with my friends
because we all enjoy the same kinds of films.
Examiner: Do you think that English will be useful to you in
the future?
Maria:
Yes, I think it will be very useful. I want to work
for an international company, so I hope I'll travel
to different countries with my job, and I'm sure
will need English.
Examiner: Tell us about a place you would like to visit in the
future.
Maria: I'd love to go to New York one day because it
looks such an exciting city. My uncle lives there,
so I hope I can go and visit him soon.
Examiner: Can you describe your house or flat?
Maria: My flat is quite small, because l just share it with
one friend. The kitchen is very small, but the
living room is quite big. Also, it's got a balcony,
and I really like sitting there in the evening.
Examiner: What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
Maria: Well, I'm quite into sport, so I do quite a lot of
sport in my free time. For example, I sometimes
go running in the evenings and l often play
tennis at the weekend. I also like spending time
with friends. My friends are very important to
me.
