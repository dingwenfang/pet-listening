Pablo: The picture shows two teenagers playing basketball
outdoors. I think they might be in a car park or something
like that. It isn't a very attractive place, because there are
no flowers, and there isn't any grass. It's a cloudy day, and it
doesn't look very warm because one of the boys is wearing
long sleeves. The two boys are at the front of the photo,
in the middle, and at the back we can see a basketball
net and some buildings. They look like garages or sheds,
something like that. On the left, you can see some houses
in the background. The boys aren't actually playing a game,
but they're practising. One of the boys is wearing a stripy
top, with a hood, and he's holding the ball above his head.
He seems to be aiming for the net, which is quite a long way
away. The other boy, who's short and has dark hair, is running
forwards. I think maybe he's going to catch the ball. I guess
the two boys are probably friends because they don't look
like brothers.
