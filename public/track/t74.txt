Track 74
Maria:The photo shows two people sitting in a living room
in a house, a teenager and an older man. I think they're
probably father and son. The teenager, who's on the right, is
wearing a pullover and jeans, and the older man is wearing
a blue shirt and jeans. He's got grey hair. The sitting room
looks quite modern, and the sofa looks very comfortable.
In the background, on the left, you can see some photos on
a table. On the right, you can see some books. They might
be watching TV because you can see that they're looking at
something, and there is a remote control, or something like
that on the sofa on the right. They're eating something from
a box, some kind of a takeaway. It looks like pizza. They seem
to be quite relaxed. I guess they're probably having a relaxing
evening at home.
