Track 76
Pablo: So, shall we talk about the barbecue first? I think
it's a good idea. A barbecue is relaxing, and
everyone can enjoy it. What do you think?
Maria: Yes, I agree with you. The only problem is that
someone has to organise everything, like buying
the food and cooking it, so it's quite a lot of work.
In my opinion, eating in a restaurant would be
better,because no one would have to cook.
Pablo:
Yes, that's a good point. But a meal in a restaurant
might be too expensive for some people. What do
you think about going to watch a football match ?
Maria: Well, it would be perfect for me, because I'm a
football fan, but I don't think it's a good idea for
a class celebration, because not everyone likes
football.
Pablo: That's true. So, would the beach be a good idea?
Everyone likes going to the beach. Do you agree?
Maria: I'm not sure. What if the weather's bad?
Pablo: Yes, you're right. The beach is great if the
weather's good, but it's really boring if it's raining.
So, what else is there? I don't think hiking is a
good idea, because some people might not be fit
enough to enjoy it.
Maria: Yes, I agree. What about going to a theme park? I'm
sure people would enjoy that.
Pablo: Yes, that's a good idea. There are different rides,
too, so not everyone has to go on the really scary
ones. It's definitely more fun than a boat trip. That
would be really boring, in my opinion.
Maria: I agree, because on a boat you're just sitting there
for a few hours, but I prefer to be active.
Pablo: What about the zoo? That could be fun. And there
are things to do indoors if it's wet.
Maria: Yes, that's true. And everyone loves animals.
Pablo: So, it's time to decide. I would choose the theme
park or the zoo because I think everyone would
enjoy them.
Maria: Yes. I think the theme park would be more fun, sol
would choose that.
Pablo: OK. We'll go for that one, then.
