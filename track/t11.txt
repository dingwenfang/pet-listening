Tanya: Have you got a moment, Gareth?
Gareth: Yeah, go on!
Tanya:Well,youknowourteacherswantustovoteona
new school subject, can we talk about them first?
Gareth:Sure!
Tanya: Shall we start with creative writing?
Gareth: OK, go on...
Tanya: Don't you think it would be a great idea? I'd love
to learn how to write fiction.
Gareth: Um...I don't think many of our classmates will
agree with you. How about communication skills?
Our teachers often ask us to give presentations
and I'm sure knowing how to speak to large
groups will be useful in the future.
Tanya: Good point. Let's talk about another subject. Then
we can decide. Perhaps our teachers could teach
us how to manage money. You know, how to save
and how not to spend too much.
Gareth: Do you really think so? None of us earn money so
we can't save or spend.
Tanya: That's my point. Whenever we get money, we go
out and spend it!
Gareth: I think it'd be better to do something like bicycle
repair so that I can mend the tyres on my bike.
Tanya: I don't agree. Some of us don't have bikes. What's
left on the list? Let's see.... What about learning
how to look after a home? That's home economics
you know, how to cook and clean or how to fix the
washing machine.
Gareth: I'm not sure about that one.
Tanya:NoramI.
Gareth: Yeah! I'd prefer to do computer programming and
then we could design some cool new games.
Tanya: That's true but I still think communication skills is
the best option.
Gareth: So do I. Let's go for that.
