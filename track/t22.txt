 Justyna: I'm here to tell you about our bushcraft courses.

 Since 2007, we've been teaching people the necessary skills to stay alive in the wild by using the things around them.

 So what are weekend courses like? On Saturd morning, your guide will pick you up for your adventure in front of the station and drive you to our main office. First you'll need to repack your backpack with just the essential equipment and then it's time to walk to the forest camp.

 The first lesson is how to use the equipment, for example you will learn how to hold a knife properly so that you don't hurt yourself or others

 The next job is building your own hut. It doesn't need to be beautiful but it will be your place to spend the night, as it will get cold. But don't worry, your guide will have an emergency tent for the group to sleep in if necessary.

 You'll learn how to catch a rabbit, although I can't promise you'll be lucky enough to get one. If you do, I'll show you how to prepare it and we'll have it for lunch. We'll also go fishing in the river but whatever we catch there, we will have to put back
 into the water. Those are the rules in this area.

 Over the rest of the weekend you'll learn how to find drinking water, use the stars and moon to navigate and check the clouds for rain or a change

 in temperature.
