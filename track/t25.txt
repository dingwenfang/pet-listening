 Track 25
 Rafael: Who do you most enjoy chatting to?
 Lian: To my friends. Especially my best friend Jia, who
 goes to a different school from me. We always
 have so much to say to each other! How about
 you?
 Rafael:
 Yes, to friends too. And also to my cousin Antonio.
 He's about the same age as me and we get on
 really well so we spend a lot of time talking to
 each other. How do you usually chat? By phone?
 Lian: Quite often, but sometimes we text. Especially
 when it's difficult to talk aloud, for instance if I'm
 in the library. And you?
 Rafael: Mostly on Instagram, if I've got an internet
 connection of course. And it doesn't cost anything
 to post messages, which is great. I can't do that at
 school, though. When can you chat to people
 Lian: In the evenings, mainly. After I finish my
 homework and I can relax. I think that's the best
 time. What about you?
 Rafael: Oh, I can't wait that long. I check my messages
 and reply as soon as I get out of school! It's usually
 to make plans for the evening or just to catch
 up with what's going on. What do you most like
 chatting about?
 Lian: Sorry, could you say that again?
 Rafael: Sure. What do you most like chatting about?
 Lian: Well, Jia and I often give each other advice. For
 example if I'm worried about something, I ask her
 what I should or shouldn't do and she might tell
 me what I could do. I think that's very important.
 Do you agree?
 Rafael: Yes, I do. That's what friends are for. But other
 times they tell me about something funny that's
 happened and we laugh and I think that's good
 too. What do you think?
 Lian: Oh yes, definitely, It's not good to be serious all
 the time!
