 Track 27
 Clare: Nick, I'm doing a school project about television
 and I'd like to ask you some questions.
 Nick: Sure.
 Clare: How much TV do you watch?
 Nick: Quite a lot actually. When get up, I often watch
 a bit of a series on my mobile while I'm having
 breakfast or finishing my homework.
 Clare:
 Oh? Do you watch TV when you are studying? I
 can't concentrate when the TV's on.
 Nick: When I'm studying hard for an exam, no, I can't
 watch TV at the same time, but when I'm doing
 something easy or finishing an exercise, I leave the
 TV on. like the noise in the background.
 clare: Have you got TV in your bedroom?
 Nick:
 No, I don't but I don't need one. I mainly watch TV
 on my mobile or tablet.
 Clare: Ah! That was my next question. How do you watch
 TV?
 Nick: As I said, mainly on my mobile or tablet. I watch
 sports programmes on the TV in our living room
 but for everything else, I watch it online. I think I
 mostly use websites like YouTube.
 clare: And do you think that TV is too violent?
 Nick:
 I'm not sure to be honest because I don't really
 like those sorts of pogrammes. I prefer comedy
 series,wildlife documentaries and even cooking
shows and none of those are violent!
Clare:
Do you ever go to the theatre or to the cinema?
Nick:
My parents love going to see plays but I find them
a bit dull.
Clare:
Well, that's all my questions. Thanks, Nick.
