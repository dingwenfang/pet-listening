Track 28
Bella:
Have you seen The Lion King yet?
Eliza:
Do you mean the musical?
Bella: Yeah! We've got a spare ticket for the Friday show.
Fancy coming?
Eliza:
Um...
Bella:
Please!We've been good friends for three years
but we haven't been to a show together since last
summer.
Eliza:
Yes I know but I've already seen it. I saw it with my
cousins last month but I'd love to do something
else with you. How about Saturday? I haven't seen
the new Robin Hood film yet. Everyone's talking
about it and it's on at the cinema near us. Have
you seen it?
Bella:
Fraid so. I saw it last night with my mum. Let's
have a look at the guide to see what else is on.
What about Carmen? It says here that it's an
incredible show with dancing and live music
Sounds good
Eliza:
Carmen? Fantastic idea. I've just learned how to
play one of the songs on the violin and my sister is
learning to sing one of them too
Bella: Oh no! It's not an opera, is it? I don't fancy that!
Eliza:
Why don't you come round to my house on
Saturday and we can watch a film.
Bella: And why don't l get a pizza on my way to your
house?
