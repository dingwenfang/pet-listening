Track 33
Mia:
Look at the rain. Owen.
Owen:
Yes, I know. I'm hoping it'll stop soon, but I don't
think there's much chance of that.
Mia:
No,the weather forecast said it's a big storm,so
it's going to rain for hours. What time do you have
to be at the station?
Owen:
I'm meeting Jason and Mark there at 8.30, in the
cafe near the main entrance. The train leaves at
8.45.
Mia:
It's quite a long walk to the station, isn't it? And it's
8.15 already. Look, I'll ask my mum to take you in
the car.
Owen:
Thanks!
