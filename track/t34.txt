Track 34
Lewis: Next week I'm going to Australia! I'm arriving in
the north, so first I'm going to stay overnight in
Darwin. My guidebook says it's an interesting city,
so I think I'll do a bit of sightseeing there. Then
I'm getting the train to Alice Springs, right in the
middle of the country, where I'll spend the night
at a campsite. The next day I'm hoping to get a lift
down the main road. I'm taking all my things in
a backpack so that I don't have to carry a heavy
suitcase around.
About 200 kilometres south of Alice, I'll reach a
crossroads where there's a signpost that says
'Uluru 247 km'. Uluru is also known as Ayers Rock-
one of the most amazing sights in the world.
