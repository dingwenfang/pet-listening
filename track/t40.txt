Track 40
Narrator: You will hear a man called Bob Richards talking
about how to get famous on YouTube.
Presenter: Hi! Bob Richards here. About a billion people
around the world use You Tube. While some
people just watch videos, others upload around
300 hours of them a minute. That means that by
the time I finish this introduction there'll be 500
hours of new videos on YouTube.Have you ever
dreamt of becoming a famous YouTuber? Here's
my advice to get you started.
Do your research! Find out what kind of videos
people are into right now by searching for
'Popular on You Tube' and then choose your
style. Everyone loves watching animals doing
funny things, and in fact the first ever video or
YouTube was a visit to a zoo, but the ones with
the most likes are often music videos.
Next, think about how you can make something
bigger, better and different, something that you
and the people you know would like to watch.
Your audience will also want to get to know you
Avoid being a clown or a film star, just act like
yourself.
Practise making very short high-quality videos
first. Tell your friends about your videos and ask
them for their opinion. However, aim to upload
at least 10 good ones before letting them know
about your channel. People won't be impressed
if you've only got a few videos there.
Make sure you upload new videos at least once
a week. Choose a day and let the people who
follow you know. To increase the number of
people watching your videos, your title can be
as unusual as you like-as always,try to be a bit
different but make sure you have a description,
and it's clear
Many people give up after two or three months
because nobody's watching but attracting a
large audience takes time, often two or three
years. It's hard work, but definitely worth it!
