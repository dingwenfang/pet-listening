Track 47
Narrator: What will Natalie buy for the picnic?
Natalie: Have we got everything we need for the picnic?
Sam:
Hang on! Let me check. Do you know what? We
haven't got any bread.
Natalie: You're joking! I'll get some from the bakery on
our way there. No, I've got a better idea. I'll cycle
down to the supermarket now and I'll buy another
bottle of water too. I'll also get some crisps while
I'm there.
