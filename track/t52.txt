Madison: What have you done to your hair, Layla?
Layla: Oh don't. I normally have my hair cut at Gabrielle's
but I wanted something different, so I went to that
new place on the High Street.
Madison: Oh no! Was it very expensive?

Andrew: Are you coming to the party tonight, Lewis?
Lewis: I can't. I'm not allowed to go out.
Andrew: Why's that?
Lewis: I had a little accident on my scooter. My dad says
it was my fault.
Andrew: What about your scooter? You only got it last week
for your birthday.
Lewis: That's why my dad is so angry. We're having the
scooter repaired and I'm going to have to look for
a job to pay for it.

Vicki:
Oh no, Charlie! That's cola you've spilt down my
dress.
Charlie: Sorry, Vicki. It was an accident.
Vicki:
My mum's going to go mad. I had this dress
cleaned last week for a party, and it wasn't cheap!
