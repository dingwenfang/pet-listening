Examiner: Now I'd like each of you to talk on your own
about something.I'm going to give each of you
a photograph and I'd like you to talk about it.
Luna, here is your photograph. It shows people
shopping on a rainy day. Lidia, you just listen.
Luna,please tell us what you can see in your
photograph.
Luna:
Uh-huh. In this picture, I can see a lot of people
outside. It's a rainy day and the people are
shopping. The street is quite crowded. I can see
many shops, for example: a mobile phone shop
and a shoe shop. In the middle of the picture,
there are two women. One of them is carrying
something.I can't remember the word for this
object. It's used for the rain... we open it when it
rains. She's wearing a long black coat, and black
shoes. The other woman is wearing a coat and
a red scarf, grey jeans and boots. On her back,
she's got...a...it's something like a bag.In front
of them, there's another woman. She's wearing
a blue coat. She's got a...a...two bags. One is
on her back. It's made of leather. The other bag
is black and it's enormous. It looks heavy. In the
background, I think I can see some flags, I'm not
sure....
Examiner:Thank you.
