Track 55
Presenter: Scientists in Antarctica have used a new
invention to help them study penguins close
up:a tiny robot on wheels that looks like a baby
penguin. The robot, similar to those used in the
exploration of the moon and Mars, provided
lots of exciting new information about the
birds. Scientists, working some distance away,
controlled every movement the robot made and
it was immediately accepted by penguin families
as one of them. The adults even sang to it,
though to their great disappointment the'baby
didn't reply. The scientists are now working on a
new model with one important improvement-it
will be able to play penguin songs.
