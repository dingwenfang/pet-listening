Track 59
Helen: Sonia, can you take notes today?
Sonia: Oh, is it my turn to be secretary? OK.
Helen: Right. As you know, we have to decide what even
we're going to organise to raise money for UNICEF.
Any ideas? Yes, Adam?
Adam: OK. Last year we organised a disco to collect
money. We can organise a similar event again.
Helen: Mm. I think Year 10 are going to organise a party this
year. Has anyone else got any other ideas? John?
John:
Yeah, we've thought about organising a football
match.
Helen: Another football match? There are matches here
every Saturday.
John: In my sister's school, the students are going to
play against the teachers.
Helen: But the teachers here wouldn't want to play
football.
John: It doesn't have to be just teachers. Ellie's dad
could play. He used to play football for United.
Helen: But how are we going to raise money?
John: The adults will have to pay to play.
Helen: Sounds good. Mm. Anyone else? Nina?
Nina: Yes. Look at everyone! We're all using our
phones right now. How about something like a
technology-free day?
Helen: A technology-free day? How does that work?
Nina: The idea is to have a day where we can't use any
technology. We won't use any screens, internet or
phones
Helen: And the money?
Nina: People will sponsor us not to use technology.
We'll turn off the electricity and hold some special
technology-free events instead, like story-telling
or a picnic.
Helen:Thanks.Right.Think about the suggestions.And
don't forget the meeting tomorrow. We'll take a
vote then.
