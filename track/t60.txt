Lisa:
Hi Sonia. Sorry I didn't get to the meeting
yesterday. What did you decide?
Sonia: Oh, hi Lisa. There's going to be another meeting
today at 1 pm to take a vote. We have to think
about the three suggestions.
Lisa:
What three suggestions? Did anyone take notes?
Sonia: Yeah! I was the secretary. I've got them written
here. Let me see. Oh yes, Adam said that they had
organised a disco to collect money the year before
and they could organise a similar event again.
Lisa:
But isn't Year 10 going to organise a party?
Sonia: Yes, that's what Helen said. Then John said they
had thought about organising a football match.
Lisa:
Not another football match.
Sonia: Well, not exactly... he said in his sister's school,
the students were going to play against the
teachers. He also said that it didn't have to be just
teachers.It could be any adult-like Ellie's dad
who used to play football. John said the adults
would have to pay to play.
Lisa:
You said there were three suggestions, didn't you?
Sonia: Yes, the third came from Nina. She pointed out
that they were all using their mobiles then.
She suggested a day when they wouldn't be
able to use technology at all. She said people
would sponsor them and they would turn off the
electricity and hold some special technology-free
events instead.
Lisa:
Good idea.
