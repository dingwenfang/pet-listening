the gap. Write one or two words or a number or
a date or a time.
Catherine: Let me tell you about an app design competition
which will take place in Lisbon, Portugal from
the sixth to the seventh of June. All you need to
do is fill in an online form by the first of June. If
your application is accepted, you should hear
from us before the fourth of June. On the day,
you can take part alone or join one of the teams
You'll need to choose one of the challenges from
a list of four and create an app which solves a
problem. Last year's challenges were connected
to the environment. For example, one of the
challenge winners created an app which finds
the nearest recycling bin for the rubbish you
want to throw away. All I can say about this year
is that the challenges have something to do with
communication. The rest is a secret!
The competition judge is blogger Fran Maddison,
that's M-A-D-D-I-S-O-N. She presents the'Apps
Programme'on Channel Seven.Her latest book
'Apps are me' will be on sale soon.
There are some amazing prizes. There's Â£1,000
and a tablet for the best app for each challenge
The four winners will then compete in the final
for the first prize which is an unbelievable trip to
California.
You won't be able to bring your own food into the
event,but reasonably priced refreshments will
be available. You'll be able to hire headphones
and chargers. You mustn't forget your laptop, but
you'll be able to hire headphones and chargers
there.
And finally, if you can't make the Conference
Centre in Lisbon in June, consider the Grand
Hotel in Prague in October. There'll be more
information about this event on our website at
the end of August.
Now,any questions...?
