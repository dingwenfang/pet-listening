Cindy: What does the app do, Emily?
Emily: It's an exam organiser app, Cindy. You put in when
your exams are, how much you need to study for
each subject, the topics you need to study and the
app creates a study plan for you.
Harry: That could save some time. Does it do anything
else?
Emily: Yes, Harry, it tells you when to take a break and
have something to eat too. It also recommends
different types of physical exercise and the alarm
reminds you to get enough sleep. It's a bit like one
of those fitness watches but for school work.
Phil:
Can I use it to share stuff with my friends?
Emily: Yeah and that's the most useful thing, I think,
Phil. You can make study groups so that you can
ask questions, share notes, tips and ideas and
generally help each other.
Diana: Fantastic! Where did you get the idea from?
Emily: Well, Diana, one of the competition challenges was
called'efficient study through communication'
and I thought of this idea. I never thought we
would win though!
Lily: That's amazing, Emily! But will the app do my
exams for me ?
Emily: That would be unfair, Lily!
