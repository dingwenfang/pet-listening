Examiner: Victoria, how often do you use the internet?
Victoria: I'm sorry, could you say that again please?
Examiner: Do you often use the internet?
Victoria: The internet? I use it every day. When I wake up
I check Facebook on my phone. At school, we go
on the internet to look for information and then
when I do my homework, I often use the internet
to check my answers. I also use it to listen to
music and to watch films. I couldn't live without it.
Examiner: Thank you.
