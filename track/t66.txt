Track 66
Journalist: Good afternoon. I'm a journalist for Channel
Thirteen and we're doing some research into
communication amongst young people for a TV
programme. I was wondering if I could ask you
some questions about how you use social media.
Bradley: Sure. What would you like to know?
Journalist: Firstly, could you tell me what your name is,
please?
Bradley: Yes, it's Bradley Jones.
Journalist: Thanks, Bradley. I'd like to know how many
different kinds of social media you use.
Bradley: I don't use as many as most of my friends or my
sister even. I suppose I mainly use Instagram and
Snapchat.
Journalist: Really? Could I ask you what you use each one
for?
Bradley: Yes, I use Instagram to see what people are up
to. It's also great for following famous people.
Snapchat is good when you're out somewhere
and you want to send a photo to your friends.
Journalist: And now for the last question. We're also
interested in whether young people know about
some of the dangers of using social media. Do
you have any idea what some of the dangers
are?
Bradley:Ithinkso.Doyoumeanthingslikenotgivingtoo
much information to strangers and being careful
about who can see your photos?
Journalist: Yeah, that's right. Thanks for your answers,
Bradley. They're all very useful for our research.
