Examiner: Tell us about your English teacher.
Pablo: My English teacher is called Mr Adams, and
he's from Manchester. He's really funny, and I
like him because he always makes our lessons
interesting.I think he's a really good teacher.
Examiner: Would you like to live in a different country?
Pablo: I'd like to visit different countries, for example
the United States or maybe Australia, to get
some experience of what life is like there. But
I wouldn't like to for long, because I'd miss my
family and friends at home.
Examiner: Can you tell us about your home town?
Pablo: My home town is Barcelona, in the north-east
of Spain. It's a big city, and there are lots of
beautiful buildings which are very famous. I like
it because it's very friendly, and there are lots of
cafes where you can meet your friends. Also, it's
on the coast, so you can go to the beach in the
summer.
Examiner: How do you usually travel to school or work?
Pablo: I usually catch the bus to school. It takes about
half an hour for me to get there. I'd prefer to
walk, but it's too far for me to walk every day.
Examiner: What did you do last weekend?
Pablo: On Saturday I played football for my team.
We usually have a match every Saturday.
Unfortunately, we didn't win last week. Then
on Sunday I met my friends, and we went to the
beach because it was very hot.
