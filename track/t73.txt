Track 73
Pablo: The picture shows some people who are travelling by
bus. There are two women at the front of the picture, on the
left. They're smiling, and one woman is showing the other
one something on her phone. On the right, there's an older
man.He's looking forwards.I'm not sure what he's looking
at, but maybe he's thinking about where to get off the bus. In
the background, at the back of the bus, there's a man. He's
standing up and I think he's talking to another passenger.
