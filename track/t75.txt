Track 75
Maria: So, shall we start with the book? What do you
think about that idea?
Pablo: I'm not sure. Some people enjoy reading, but a lot
of people don't like it. And it's difficult to choose a
book for someone else
Maria: I agree with you. And I don't think flowers are
a good idea because they're a bit boring, in my
opinion.
Pablo: That's true. In my opinion, people buy flowers if
they can't think of any other ideas. Would a T-shirt
be a good idea? Most people wear T-shirts.
Maria: Well, I don't really like it when people buy me
clothes, because I prefer to choose them myself.
Pablo: OK, so not a T-shirt. Would a concert ticket be a
good idea?
Maria: Yes, I think that's a great idea. Everyone loves
listening to live music.
Pablo: No, I disagree. There's only one ticket, and I don't
think it would be fun to go to a concert on your own.
Maria: Yes, you're right. But there are two cinema tickets,
so maybe they might be a better choice.
Pablo: Yes, I agree they would be a good choice. So,
what else is there? I think a mug is boring, and
chocolates seem quite a cheap present. What do
you think?
Maria: Yes, I agree. And I'm sure she'd love to get a
necklace,so that's a possibility.
Pablo: OK. So, it's time to decide. What do you think?
Maria: Well, I would say either the cinema tickets or the
necklace.Do you agree?
Pablo: Yes, but the necklace might be too expensive, so
maybe we should choose the cinema tickets. Are
you OK with that?
Maria: Yes, good idea. We'll go for that one, then.
